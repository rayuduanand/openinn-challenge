This document serves as a complete high-level and technical overview of the Azure AKS Hub-and-Spoke project. It is designed to be accessible for developers, DevOps engineers, and architects alike.

Azure AKS with Terraform Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

This document outlines a comprehensive infrastructure and application deployment strategy for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using a hub-and-spoke network topology and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

#### Infrastructure Setup #############
Infrastructure Setup:
Terraform Modules

Key components modularized using Terraform:

Hub Network: Central VNet with Azure Firewall, Bastion Host, and Gateway Subnets

Spoke Network: Connected AKS subnets peered to the hub

AKS Cluster: Managed Kubernetes cluster with configurable node pools

Log Analytics: Centralized logging and metrics

Key Vault: Centralized and secure secret management

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own configurations with scaling and security settings tailored to its usage

Infrastructure Deployment Workflow

Managed through GitLab CI/CD:

Validation: Run TFLint and Checkov for syntax and security validation

Sonar-check: Code quality scanning using SonarQube

SAST: Static Application Security Testing

TrivyScan: Container vulnerability scanning

Plan: Generate an execution plan to preview changes

Apply: Apply infrastructure changes with approval gates for production

Destroy: Remove infrastructure for temporary environments or cleanup

#### Application Setup and Deployment #############

Application Stack

Frontend: Web user interface

Backend: API service

PostgreSQL HA: High-availability relational database

Ingress-NGINX: Handles external traffic routing

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager for observability

Deployment Strategy with Helmfile

Helm Charts: Each component has a chart in /helm

Helmfile: Coordinates multi-chart deployment using helmfile.yaml

Environment Values: Each environment has its own values config

Deploy Commands:

# Shell script
./deploy_app_aks.sh <environment>

# Or directly with Helmfile
helmfile -e <environment> apply

Reliability and Resilience:
Velero Backups: Periodic backups for both application state and AKS cluster resources
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales pods based on CPU/memory usage
Cluster Autoscaler: Dynamically adjusts node count in AKS node pools based on workload demand
Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs): Maintains service availability during voluntary disruptions

Future Improvements:
GitOps Implementation
Centralized Secrets Management using HashiCorp Vault
Cost Optimization: Schedule automated AKS cluster start/stop operations during non-peak hours to reduce costs
